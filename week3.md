<h1>Week 3</h1>
<h2>Learning Activities and resources</h2>
This week's learning activities included learning about the way that wordpress handles content management and how it can be used, and learning how to do effective group interviews to create the group for practicals moving forward and the 2nd assignment. The resources used included WordPress's own tutorials and the ones provided by JCU. I also used blogs from interviewers to construct interview questions.
<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
Estimated hours overall between learning, getting people to make the group to do interviews in and constructing the WordPress site would be roughly 3 hours.
<h2>Content Insights</h2>
Wordpress, much like Joomla and other CMS that I have seen seems to be better suited for blog styled websites more often than not, which is good for fast paced environments, but not what I would be using my website design knowledge for.
<h2>Career Insights</h2>
One aspect I found would be good for my future career is being the position of the interviewer, trying to find people suitable for my goals and my preferences regarding what type of job I wish to see out of my fellow group members. It puts me in the position of higher power that if I stick with my career I will eventually will reach. It also makes me appreciate my current higherups and what they do on a daily basis.

<h2>INTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
Unfortunately, only one person has come forward to do an interview with me, however it has allowed me to get great insight.
<h3>Harry Groemer</h3>
Q1: What time do you have free to do the required group assessment tasks?

A1: I work a job usually 3 days a week, but no more than 20 hours a week. Apart from those work times, I am available.


Q2: What is your experience regarding group projects?

A2: I have done many group projects. These being through previous Uni and School classes as well as various smaller projects through work.


Q3: Any particular strengths you say you have when it comes to group projects? Examples?

A3: I am a very good communicator and can work well with anyone. I am also a fast learner willing to do any work required for the group's satisfaction.

An example, when doing a project there were conflicting ideas between members. I was able to talk to the members and find a common ground where they were both happy.

Conclusion: Harry will be a key group member for the upcoming projects, he seems to be compatible with what I want out of a group member, hopefully others will be the same.
