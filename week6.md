<h1>Week 6</h1>
<h2>Learning Activities and resources</h2>
This week's learning activities included getting the group organized for the second assignment. The resources used for this is email, slack, discord, trello and github.
<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
This week's hours estimate to about 3.
<h2>Content Insights</h2>
This week's content explored into project management, three subjects I have completed, and version control via git and github, which I use extensively for my programming. I have not gained insight unlike previous weeks because of how regularly I use these aspects already.
<h2>Career Insights</h2>
This week's content I can apply to my career however by it getting me to think about how I manage projects with a team in a corporate environment. This is more of a reflection at my time at Wilmar Sugar with Document Management and how the version control was not tested with the ELO program I worked on, causing problems to occur with the migration of documents.
