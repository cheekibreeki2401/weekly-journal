<h1>Week 4</h1>
<h2>Learning Activities and resources</h2>
This week's learning activities includes how to set up for local hosting to eventually deploy live. I have set up a LAMP configuration to get wordpress to work on my local EndeavourOS system, which took some research to do using a variety of tutorials from wordpress themsevles. It has also got me to explore plugins for my site.
<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
Roughly 3 hours trying to set up the local host.
<h2>Content Insights</h2>
This has made me realise what goes into setting up a site properly to deliver the information over network. Setting up apache, php and mariadb (MySql equivalent) has been a slight nightmare but it has helped me to get more comfortable with my system.
<h2>Career Insights</h2>
While I do not think myself getting into any form of network or web development, this has certainly helped me understand how the net works better and what is required to even host the pages I visit every day. It has also sparked some ideas for web interfacing with my final project that might be implemented.
