<h1>Week 1</h1>
<h2>Learning Activities and resources</h2>
This week, my learning activies included research into what this subject will entail and refresh myself HTML and CSS based syntax, which has been completed succesfully as of the time of writing.
<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
Through remembering HTML based on the Web Design subject and the hours spent on prac 1, I estimate roughly 5-6 hours of learning and work done.
<h2>Content insights</h2>
The insights I have learned is that simple nature of UI design and that the refresh of web design will be quite valuable in this subject, alongside the additional research into third party hosting plans
<h2>Career insights</h2>
This will help me with designing the graphical version of my project this year which has been mentioned on my website itself (The Universal Tagging System and specifically GUTS). It would do me well to do occasional refreshes of courses I have completed since it is never truly known if there is a particular skillset that you require at any given time.
