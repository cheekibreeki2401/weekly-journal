<h1>Week 1</h1>
<h2>Learning Activities and resources</h2>
This week, my learning activities included research into content management systems and how web hosting actually works. I did this by my own research and watching the lecture videos which contained invaluable insight into what happens behind the curtain with a website.
<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
Through watching of the video, setting up my AWS web hosting and getting familiar with Joomla translating my website to it, I have done approx. 3 hours of work and learning done.
<h2>Content Insights</h2>
The insights I have learned includes the point of content management systems to dynamically change web pages as needed rather than purely static web pages. I have also gained an understanding of what web hosting truly entails
<h2>Career Insights</h2>
This will help me further with my open source goals by getting an understanding with web hosting and CMS for online programming, a peak behind what I will need to set up if I am to do this without proprietary software in the assistance of it. Already implementing some of the concepts into my own web server.
